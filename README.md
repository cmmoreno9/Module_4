# School District Analysis

## 1. Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of the challenge was to organize and analyze school district data in order to provide insights into performance trends and patterns. Data given included funding and standardized tests. The data will then be taken into account when setting budget allotments. However, one of the high schools, Thomas High School, showed substantial evidence of academic dishonesty. Consequently, replacing math and reading scores for Thomas High School was done to uphold state-testing standards. 

## 2. Results 

1) There were slight changes in the district summary. The overall passing percent was 65.2% in the original but dropped to 64.9%. However this is not a drastic signigicant change. Other differences took place in the tenth place and had less than 1% difference.

2) A major change regarding test scores is THS(Thomas High Schools) passing reading percentage. In the orginal code the passing percent was 97.3%, however in the new code the passing percent was 69.6%. Additionally, in the orignal code the overall passing rate was around 90%, however after excluding 9th graders the percentage dropped to 65%.

3) In the original code THS ranked second in school performance, however, after adjusting the code, THS falls into 8th place. 

4) Looking at the math and reading scores, the results have been replaced by NaN since the 9th grade tests were removed.
